# Libft

 The __*libft*__ project at [42](https://www.42.fr/) is the first project in the curriculum. It consists in coding a C library regrouping usual functions that we are then allowed to use in all our projects. We are encouraged to continuously expand our library with new useful functions.

My library now contains more than 130 functions to manipulate characters, strings, arrays, lists, etc.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run `make`.
A static library named **_libft.a_** will be compiled.
All the functions in the library are prefixed with *ft_* (meaning *forty-two*).
To use those functions, simply add `include <libft.h>` in your *.c* or *.h* files and compile your program with the library.
